# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects using R

## Overview
This repository contains two exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects demonstrating data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insights extraction using **R**. Each project explores a unique dataset and answers key research questions through **statistical analysis and visualizations**.

## Projects

### 📌 **Project 1: Retail Customer & Sales Analysis**  
**File:** `Project_2.qmd` *(Report: `Project_2.pdf`)*  
**Dataset:** `Online Retail.xlsx`  

#### 🔹 Key Research Questions:
- Who are the biggest spending customers, and how can we improve their experience?
- What are the best-selling products, and how do they contribute to sales?
- How do seasonal trends affect sales and customer retention?
- What is the overall customer retention rate, and what factors influence it?

#### 🛠️ **Techniques Used:**
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Removing duplicates, handling missing values, filtering out invalid data
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), product sales trends, seasonal trends
- **Data Visualization:** Bar charts, line graphs, histograms

### 📌 **Project 2: Olympic Performance & Medal Distribution Analysis**  
**File:** `Project_3.qmd` *(Report: `Project_3.pdf`)*  
**Datasets:** `olympic_medals.csv`, `olympic_hosts.csv`, `olympic_athletes.csv`, `olympic_results.csv`  

#### 🔹 Key Research Questions:
- How have medal-winning trends changed over time for top-performing countries?
- Which sports contribute the most medals for leading countries?
- Is there a "host country advantage" in medal counts?
- How do Summer and Winter Olympics compare in terms of medal distribution?
- How has gender distribution evolved in the Olympics over time?

#### 🛠️ **Techniques Used:**
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Standardizing categories, merging datasets, handling missing values
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Medal trends, host country advantage, gender representation
- **Data Visualization:** Line charts, bar plots, stacked histograms
